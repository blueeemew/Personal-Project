    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Soto was a food that was specially cooked for the Dutch nation. The Dutch nation wanted a food like gulai, but did not want it to be spicy and cooked with too much spice. With those conditions, soto is made with spices that are not spicy, but savory. Previously, soto only consisted of meat (chicken or cow), potato, and spring onion; the soup was pure cow’s milk. Later on, soto used coconut milk since cow’s milk is too expensive. <br><br>The term ‘Soto betawi’ has only appeared in 1977-1978. It gained its popularity because of someone who sells it at THR Lokasari/Prinsen Park and is known as sotonya soto kaki pak X. It is only until the seller died in 1991 that soto is known as soto Betawi.</p>

    <h2>Food</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify">When it is served, one thing I noticed is the container that is used for serving the food has a fire lighted up underneath the bowl which keeps my food warm. In my opinion, foods that are in the form of soup is best served warm. The container used to serve the food has accomplished the task of keeping my food warm.<br><br> As can be seen in the picture, there are tomatoes, meat, and celery. It smells delicious, but I can’t help to be disappointed when there are no emping that is usually served together with Soto Betawi. Moving on, I tried it and the soup is very creamy, it is a type of soup that people can finish without feeling nauseated. In addition, the vegetables and the meat that are used are very fresh. The tomato is juicy and the meat is tender. However, I do feel like the meat is too dry.</p>

    <h2>Restaurant</h2>
    <p>When I first came in the restaurant, I didn’t feel welcomed since no one greeted me. The restaurant wasn’t crowded and there are a lot of staffs that aren’t doing anything. A few minutes after I sat down, one of the waiters approached me and gave me the menu. As people say, sometimes it’s more important for a restaurant to have better service rather than delicious food. <br><br>The restaurant “Dapur Solo” is a restaurant that is specialized in Indonesian foods. Thus, I would expect their restaurant to have famous Indonesian motives on the walls of the restaurant, and it is exactly as what I expected. If “Dapur Solo” was to open a restaurant outside of Indonesia, I would feel like I was at home just by eating at their restaurant.
