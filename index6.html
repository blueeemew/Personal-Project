    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Rawon is an Indonesian cuisine that originated from East Java. Its characteristics is having a brownish-black coloured soup. The color came from black keluak nut which is the main ingredient of rawon. It was originally a food that is common among the commoners, but then became the king’s favourite. It is one of Indonesia’s famous cuisine that has succeeded to gain its popularity among other countries.</p>

    <h2>Food</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify">When it is served, one thing I noticed is the container used for serving the food has a fire lighted up underneath the bowl which keeps my food warm. In my opinion, foods that are in the form of soup are best served warmly. Warm food has always reminded me of home, a cozy environment that I feel safe to abide in. <br><br>When the rawon is served, I was rather surprised at how it looked very plain. The served rawon looks like it is only soup with no meat. As expected, the soup was not filled with plenty of meat when I tried scooping them out. The sprouts and emping that usually accompany the rawon are given on a different plate, and this is a very smart move since it will not be too soaked and the customer can adjust the crunchiness of the sprouts and emping by leaving it in the rawon for a longer or shorter time. The meat is very tender but it is dry, it is not marinated for enough time. I do love the taste of the soup that is dominated by the taste of black keluak nut and ginger.

    <h2>Restaurant</h2>
    <p>When I first came into the restaurant, I did not feel welcome since no one greeted me. The restaurant was not crowded and there were a lot of staff that were not doing anything. A few minutes after I sat down, one of the waiters approached me and handed me the menu. As people say, sometimes it is more important for a restaurant to have better service rather than delicious food. <br><br>The restaurant “Dapur Solo” is a restaurant that is specialized in Indonesian foods. Thus, I would expect their restaurant to have famous Indonesian motives on the walls of the restaurant, and it has lived up to my expectation. If “Dapur Solo” was to open a restaurant outside of Indonesia, I would feel like I was at home by eating at their restaurant.
